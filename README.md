# Panther-Pantry
Here is my project that I created for my capstone class to finish my Computer Information Systems Associate's Degree with Portland Community College. The class is CIS234A - Real World Programming. The goal of the class was to simulate an enviornment that students would find themselves when working as a team of developers for a product owner. The product was to be an application that could be used as a notification system for Porland Community College's Food Pantry which would allow students to sign up for the notification system and allow the Food Pantry to send announcements for students.
