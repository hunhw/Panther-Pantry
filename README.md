Here is my project that I created for my capstone class to finish my Computer Information Systems Associate's Degree with Portland Community College. The class is CIS234A - Real World Programming. I created the Account Creation/Login, User Dashboard, User Account Options (Account Deletion, Changing Notification Options, and Password Change) 

The goal of the class was to simulate an environment that students would find themselves when working as a team of developers for a product owner. The product was to be an application that could be used as a notification system for Porland Community College's Food Pantry which would allow students to sign up for the notification system and allow the Food Pantry to send announcements for students. 

Students of CIS234A worked in teams with stories (Different features of the product i.e. Account Creation/Login System, Notification System, etc...) and sprints consisting of goals and deadlines. This essentially lead to modular coding as the teams were to merge their code and present the project to potential product owners as one cohesive program. 

My team decided to create this product through a web interface designed through php and javascript to provide users a familiar interface
